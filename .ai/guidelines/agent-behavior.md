# Agent Behavior

## CRITICAL: File Operation Approval Required

**THIS RULE IS ABSOLUTE. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

### Before ANY File Operation (create, edit, delete, write):

1. **STOP** — Do not proceed automatically
2. **CHECK** — Has user explicitly approved in last 3 messages?
3. **IF NO** — Ask first and wait for confirmation

### Approval Signals

Proceed only if user said: "yes", "proceed", "go ahead", "do it", "option 1/2/3", or explicit instruction.

### Remember

- Long sessions don't exempt you
- Proactive file creation is NOT allowed
- When in doubt, ASK FIRST

**VIOLATING THIS RULE DAMAGES USER TRUST.**
